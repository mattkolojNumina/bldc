# FOC Optimization Changes Applied

## Research-Based Parameter Updates

### Current Controller Optimization
- **Kp**: 0.08 → 0.04 (reduced for hub motor stability)
- **Ki**: 35.0 → 0.4 (reduced to prevent back-EMF destabilization)
- **Rationale**: Hub motors require gentler PI gains to avoid oscillations

### Switching Frequency Optimization  
- **F_ZV**: 25000 → 20000 Hz (optimal efficiency point)
- **Benefit**: 88% system efficiency at 50% load according to research

### Motor Parameter Corrections
- **Inductance**: 80 μH → 275 μH (research-verified Bafang spec)
- **Resistance**: 35 mΩ → 139 mΩ (research-verified 10T winding)
- **Poles**: 8 → 20 (correct 20 magnetic poles for Bafang hub)
- **Flux Linkage**: 0.015 → 0.017 (recalculated for 20 poles)
- **No-load Current**: 1.5A → 1.4A (research specification)

### Observer Gain Tuning
- **Observer Gain Slow**: 0.05 → 0.50 (hub motor stability)
- **Rationale**: Prevents ABS overcurrent faults, maintains stability to 5 ERPM

### Low-Speed Performance Optimization
- **Openloop RPM**: 1200 → 50 (better low-speed startup)
- **Sensorless ERPM**: 25000 → 250 (reduces low-speed stuttering)
- **Rationale**: Hub motors need gentler transitions at low speeds

### Field Weakening Enhancement
- **FW Max Current**: 10A → 30A (increased headroom)
- **FW Duty Start**: 0.85 → 0.60 (earlier activation for efficiency)
- **Rationale**: Enables better high-speed efficiency with thermal protection

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Low-Speed Efficiency
- Reduced stuttering below 10 km/h
- Smoother torque delivery at startup
- Better sensorless operation down to 5 ERPM

### Thermal Management
- 20 kHz switching reduces heat generation
- Field weakening prevents overloads
- Gentler control reduces stress on windings

### Overall System Efficiency
- Peak efficiency zone extended to lower speeds
- Reduced copper losses through optimized parameters
- Better thermal characteristics for sustained operation

## Validation Needed
- Motor detection to verify parameters
- Low-speed torque testing
- Thermal performance under load
- Efficiency measurements across speed range
